### CHALLENGE

 - Write your own version of Swift’s ```contains(_:)``` method on String class named```anotherContains()```.
 - Your implementation should be an extension on String and ignore letter case.
 - You obviously can’t use any form of the built-in ```contains(_:)``` method, but [NSString](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsstring) has some really groovy methods for ```Finding Characters and Substrings``` like ```range(of:)```.
 

Example: `print("Where is WaLdO".anotherContains("WALDO")) 
` should return `true`.
